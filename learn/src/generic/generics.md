# Generics

## Benefits Over Non-generic code

* Stronger type checks at compile time. A Java compiler applies
  strong type checking to generic code and issues errors if the code
  violates type safety. Fixing compile-time errors is easier than fixing runtime errors,
  which can be difficult to find.
* Elimination of casts. The following code snippet without generics
  requires casting:

      List list = new ArrayList();
      list.add("hello");
      String s = (String) list.get(0);

  When re-written to use generics, the code does not require casting:

      List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
      list.add("hello");
      String s = list.get(0);   // no cast
* Enabling programmers to implement generic algorithms.
  By using generics, programmers can implement generic algorithms
  that work on collections of different types, can be customized,
  and are type safe and easier to read.
