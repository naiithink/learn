# JAR

## Default Manifest

There can be only one manifest file in an archive, and it always has the pathname:

```
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
```

When you create a JAR file, the default manifest file simply contains the following:

```
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Created-By: 1.7.0_06 (Oracle Corporation)
```
