    "DESCRIPTION\n",
    "       pipe()  creates  a  pipe, a unidirectional data channel that can be used for interprocess communication.  The array pipefd is used to return two file descriptors referring to the ends of the\n",
    "       pipe.  pipefd[0] refers to the read end of the pipe.  pipefd[1] refers to the write end of the pipe.  Data written to the write end of the pipe is buffered by the kernel  until  it  is  read\n",
    "       from the read end of the pipe.  For further details, see pipe(7).\n",
    "\n",
    "       If flags is 0, then pipe2() is the same as pipe().  The following values can be bitwise ORed in flags to obtain different behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "       O_CLOEXEC\n",
    "              Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the two new file descriptors.  See the description of the same flag in open(2) for reasons why this may be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "       O_DIRECT (since Linux 3.4)\n",
    "              Create  a  pipe that performs I/O in \"packet\" mode.  Each write(2) to the pipe is dealt with as a separate packet, and read(2)s from the pipe will read one packet at a time.  Note the\n",
    "              following points:\n",
    "\n",
    "              *  Writes of greater than PIPE_BUF bytes (see pipe(7)) will be split into multiple packets.  The constant PIPE_BUF is defined in <limits.h>.\n",

    "                 ing a buffer size of PIPE_BUF will be sufficient to read the largest possible packets (see the previous point).\n",
    "\n",
    "              *  Zero-length packets are not supported.  (A read(2) that specifies a buffer size of zero is a no-op, and returns 0.)\n",
    "\n",
    "              Older kernels that do not support this flag will indicate this via an EINVAL error.\n",
    "\n",
    "              Since Linux 4.5, it is possible to change the O_DIRECT setting of a pipe file descriptor using fcntl(2).\n",
    "\n",
    "       O_NONBLOCK\n",
    "              Set the O_NONBLOCK file status flag on the open file descriptions referred to by the new file descriptors.  Using this flag saves extra calls to fcntl(2) to achieve the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "RETURN VALUE\n",
    "       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, errno is set appropriately, and pipefd is left unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "       On Linux (and other systems), pipe() does not modify pipefd on failure.  A requirement standardizing this behavior was added in POSIX.1-2016.  The Linux-specific pipe2() system call likewise\n",

    "NOTES\n",
    "       The SystemV ABI on some architectures allows the use of more than one register for returning multiple values; several architectures (namely, Alpha, IA-64, MIPS,  SuperH,  and  SPARC/SPARC64)\n",

    "EXAMPLE\n",
