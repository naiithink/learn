# Learn

**This is**:

My first ever Git repository,  
A place where I store my out-of-class learning materials,  
My programming (not just coding) playground,  
...  

**There're more on branches!**

```
ALL THE MALWARE I WROTE HAS BEEN TESTED, FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, ON MY OWN MACHINE â€“ ETHICS MATTERS.
